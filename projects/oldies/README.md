	ABOUT
	
		OLD STUFF!
		
		The content inside the folders is projects undertaken from early 2021 until the beginning of my IoT studies.
		My first ecounter, my first experiments, with the C-language! On the menu is:
		
			Tic Tac Toe - Funniest game ever (and my very first C project ever).
			Runner			- Application for keeping track of my runs.
			Tasker			- A TODO of some sort.
			
		Everything was written while reading "Learn C the Hard Way" by Zed A. Shaw and I was using his debug macros
		quite frequently (dbg.h). Except that, it's my pure original gold and I've not changed anything in the source
		code - just added make:s =)
		
	WARNING
		
		Now, I still have a lot to learn about writing less messy code and proper documentation but this... these
		source files is just one of a kind in "happy coding". Furthermore, when I wrote these applications I'd not
		begun to test for memory leaks yet why there's quite a bit of that kind while running these bad boys =)
			
		And yes, there will be bugs. A lot of fatal bugs...
				
	USAGE
	
		Download and unzip this folder ("Oldies") and enter 'make' from the terminal in each subfolder, fasten your
		seatbelt and run the executables.
